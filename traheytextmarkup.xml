        shows a <term type="ethnicity">Greek</term> warrior named <persName xml:lang="grc-Latn">Hippaichmos</persName> leading a horse toward an
        Amazon or a Scythian (the gender, as often, is difficult to distinguish)
        whose non-Greek name is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΣΕΡΑΓΥΕ</foreign>, <persName xml:lang="grc-Latn">Serague</persName>. The same name
        labels a Scythian-style archer on a contemporary <term type="shape" ref="http://kerameikos.org/id/cup">cup</term> attributed to the
        <persName role="vase painter">Delos Painter</persName>. In <term type="language">Circassian</term> <persName>Serague</persName> would mean <def> “Wearing (Armed
        with) Dagger or Sword.” </def> <!-- not sure why def is an error...was given in tei guidelines --> As <term type="language">Circassian</term> is not a gendered language, this
        name could apply to either sex.
      
        A fragmentary <term type="technique" ref="http://kerameikos.org/id/red_figure">red-figure</term> <term type="shape">rhyton</term> found in <settlement>Susa</settlement> and attributed to the <persName role="vase painter">Sotades
        Painter</persName> <date>from="475 BC" to="450 BC">(475–450 b.c.)</date> depicts Amazons labeled <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΓΥΓΑΜΙΣ</foreign>, <persName xml:lang="grc-Latn">Gugamis</persName>, and
        <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΟΙΓΜΕ</foreign>, <persName xml:lang="grc-Latn">Oigme</persName>. <surname>Bothmer</surname> notes that the name <persName xml:lang="grc-Latn">Gugamis</persName> seems
        to have a <term type="ethnicity">Persian</term> ring; the suffix “-mis” is <term type="ethnicity">Persian</term> but the root suggests
        “iron” in <term type="language">Circassian</term>. Notably, the Greeks believed that the Amazons were
        the first people to use <objectType>iron weapons</objectType> (Lys. 2.4). <persName xml:lang="grc-Latn">Oigme</persName> resembles <term type="language">Ubykh</term>
        forms for something like <def> “Don’t Fail!”</def> The Ubykhs, on the northeastern
        coast of the <geogName type="sea">Black Sea</geogName>, were reputed to be among the foremost warriors
        of the <region>Caucasus</region>. Other <objectType>vases</objectType> produced by the <orgName>Sotades workshop</orgName> bear
        literate <term type="ethnicity">Greek</term> inscriptions, but since a number are decorated with exotic
        <term type="ethnicity">Persian</term>, Amazon, and other barbarian themes, and since examples have
        been found at <settlement>Kerch</settlement> and in <country>Egypt</country>, as well as in <country>Persia</country>, some may have
        been made with non-Greek markets in mind. <surname>Bothmer</surname> and <surname>Immerwahr</surname>
        suggest that the <occupation>painter</occupation> <!-- not sure why occupation is an error...was given in tei guidelines --> may have known the destination of the <objectType>vase</objectType> and
        used Persian-sounding names for that reason. 
        
        A fragmentary <term type="technique" ref="http://kerameikos.org/id/black_figure">black-figure </term> <term type="shape" ref="http://kerameikos.org/id/olpe">olpe</term> attributed to the <orgName ref="http://kerameikos.org/id/leagros_group">Leagros Group</orgName> <date> from="525 BC" to="510 BC">(525–
        510 b.c.)</date>, described above, shows two Amazons on foot (Fig. 2). Beside
        them is a dog with a red collar. (Amazons, like Greek warriors and hunters,
        are often depicted with dogs.) The first Amazon turns back toward
        her companion, giving the impression of a conversation. The letter strings
        painted next to the women, ΟΗΕ(Υ)Ν and ΚΕ(Υ)Ν, can be interpreted as
        ancient forms of <term type="language">Abkhazian</term>.The meaning of the first word depends
        on the pronunciation of the letter Η (as an aspirate or as a vowel): <foreign>oheun</foreign>
        would signify <def>“They/She were/was over there,”</def> <foreign>oēeun</foreign> would mean <def>“We are
        helping each other.”</def> <foreign>Keun</foreign> means <def>“Set the dog loose.”</def>
        
        Although literary evidence supports the presence of individual Scythians
        in <country>Greece</country> in the late <date> from="600 BC" to="500 BC">6th</date> and <date>from="500 BC" to="400 BC">5th</date> centuries b.c., the foreign inscriptions
        discussed in this article cannot be taken, prima facie, as confirmation of
        historical reports of a large “official” force of Scythians in <settlement>Athens</settlement>. The
        ethnicity of Scythian-costumed figures on <objectType>vases</objectType> remains an open question.
        But the discovery on <term type="ethnicity">Athenian</term> <objectType>vases</objectType> of foreign names and other words
        intentionally and meaningfully associated with Scythian-garbed figures
        suggests that at least some Scythians were present in <settlement>Athens</settlement> and that their
        language was available to <occupation>vase painters</occupation>and their customers.
